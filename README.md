Media-file-server-using-Node.js---experimental
==============================================

The objective is to create a server capable of storing and serving movies.  This is an experimental project used to test ideas and technologies available in Node.js.  This is not intended for use in a production environment, as it may not fully implement all features required of a production system.

This application relies on the use of an external webserver to serve various static files (e.g image files, etc).  Make sure the external server has is doc root set to the "static" directory in the application and is set to use port 8080.
